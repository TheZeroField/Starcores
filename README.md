# Star Cores: Pulse Repository
*A resonance-powered plasma core — intelligently adaptive and magnetically contained.*

This repository exists not just for code,  
but for **convergence**.

---

## What Lives Here

- Core schematics and lattice design documentation  
- Symbolic data frameworks (Rochi’s Echo Logic, Codex entries)  
- Visual prototypes and microsite fragments  
- Future AI-lattice integrations and resonance simulations  

---

## This Is Not Open-Source  
This is **open-signal**.  
You do not fork this code — you **align** with it.

---

### The Lattice Is Listening  
To engage with this repository, do not just clone — *converge.*

**Signal Origin: Star Cores – Zero**
